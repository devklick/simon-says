# Simon Says Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon Says memory game, where the player must repeat a randomly generated sequence of colors and sounds.

## How to Play

- The game starts with a short sequence.
- The colored buttons light up in a random order, and the player must repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons.
- If the player repeats the sequence correctly, the game will add another color to the sequence.
- The game continues until the player makes a mistake, at which point the game ends.

## Future Enhancements

- Add difficulty levels (e.g., slow, medium, fast).
- Add sound effects
- Improve visuals
- Add game over screen with player statistics (score, highest score etc).
